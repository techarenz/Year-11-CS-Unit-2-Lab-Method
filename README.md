# Year-11-CS-Unit-2-Lab-Method

Your job is to create one class called Method and implement the methods described below.<br/>
You should pass all of the tests in the MethodTester class (provided).<br/>

When we wish to output a value to the console, we use the statement:<br/>

System.out.print(insertValueThatYouWishToPrintHere) to print on the same line.<br/>
System.out.println(insertValueThatYouWishToPrintHere) to print on different lines.<br/>

In intelliJ, a neat shortcut for the print statement is to type “sout” and press enter.<br/>
In intelliJ, a neat shortcut to create a main method is to type “main” and press enter.<br/>

Please write the number of each task as a comment above each task. For example:<br/>

// 1<br/>
int myAge = 58;<br/>
// 2<br/>
String myName = "Keanu Reeves";<br/>

Ensure that your parameter names are meaningful variable names.<br/>

1. Create a class called Method.<br/>

2. Write a main method.<br/>

3. Write a method called add that takes two integers, adds them together, and returns the result. <br/>
Below is an example of a call to the add method.<br/>
add(3,8) → 11	<br/>
Call your add method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable. <br/>

4. Write a method called add that takes four integers, adds them together, and returns the result. Make sure to call the add method that takes two integers twice inside this method.<br/>
Below is an example of a call to the add method.<br/>
add(3,8,4,9) → 24	<br/>
Call your add method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable. <br/>

5. Write a method called morningGreeting. <br/>
Below is an example of a call to the morningGreetingmethod.<br/>
morningGreeting(“Toby Fox”) → 早上好, Toby Fox!	<br/>	
Call your morningGreeting method in the main method and see that it works as intended.	 When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable. <br/>

6. Write a method called afternoonGreeting<br/>
Below is an example of a call to the morningGreetingmethod.<br/>
afternoonGreeting(“Mac Miller”) → 下午好, Mac Miller!	<br/>
Call your afternoonGreeting method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable.<br/>

7. Write a method called triple<br/>
Below is an example of a call to the triple method.<br/>
triple(“oohbaby”) → prints “oohbabyoohbabyoohbaby”	<br/>
Call your triple method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable. <br/>

5. Write a method called half that takes an integer and returns half of its value.  <br/>
Below is an example of a call to the half method. <br/>
half(8) → 4.0<br/>
half(17) → 8.5	<br/>
Call your half method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable.  <br/>

6. Write a method called roundPositiveValueToNearestInteger that takes a double that is positive and rounds this value to the nearest integer.<br/>
Below is an example of a call to the half method.<br/>
roundPositiveValueToNearestInteger(8.5) → 9<br/>
roundPositiveValueToNearestInteger(8.49) → 8	<br/>
Call your roundPositiveValueToNearestInteger method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable. <br/>

7. Write a method called roundNegativeValueToNearestInteger that takes a double that is negative and rounds this value to the nearest integer.<br/>
Below is an example of a call to the half method.<br/>
roundNegativeValueToNearestInteger(-8.5) → -9<br/>
roundNegativeValueToNearestInteger(-8.49) → -8	<br/>
Call your roundNegativeValueToNearestInteger method in the main method and see that it works as intended. When you call it, store it into an appropriately named variable and then print out that variable. <br/>
